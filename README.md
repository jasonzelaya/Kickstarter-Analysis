# Kickstarter Analysis

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to uncover hidden trends and the keys to success for the Kickstarter crowdfunding service. This analysis is aimed towards helping prospects determine whether or not Kickstarter is a good crowdfunding service for them to utilize. Furthermore, this analysis is also aimed at potential customers who decide to use Kickstarter to raise funds for their projects by providing them with the crucial insights necessary to achieve success.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Descriptive analysis
* Exploratory analysis

### Technologies
* Excel
* Microsoft Word

## Project Description
The dataset used is based on over four thousand past Kickstarter projects from 2009-2017. The dataset includes data on project ID, name, blurb, goal, pledged, state, country, currency, deadline, launched_at, staff_pick, backers_count, spotlight, Category and Sub-Category.

* "outcome", originally titled "state", refers to whether the project succeeded, failed, was canceled or is still live. 
* "launched_at" refers to the date the project was created in Unix timestamp format.
* "staff_pick" boolean value "TRUE" means the project received the staff pick feature and a "FALSE" value means the project did not receive the staff pick feature.
* "spotlight" boolean value "TRUE" means the project used the spotlight feature and a "FALSE" value means the project did not use the spotlight feature.
* The "deadline" and "launched_at" dates were converted from Unix timestamps to a m/d/yyyy date format in the "Date Created Conversion" and "Date Ended Conversion" columns.

#### Questions being explored: 
* What are the keys to success for Kickstarter?
* Are there any hidden trends that can be used as a guide to achieve success?
* What data needs to be taken into account to determine the keys to success?
* Have enough Kickstarter projects had success to consider Kickstarter to be the best crowdfunding source available?

#### Limitations:
* Disproportionate numbers of projects launched each year
* Misrepresentation of each country
* Outdated data
* Number of times a category or subcategory was used
* Cultural preferences
* No other crowdfunding service to compare Kickstarter to
